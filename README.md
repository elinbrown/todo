# todo
A simple todo app with Vue.js and Vuex. Uses Bulma for CSS. I wanted to learn Vuex for state management and this was my first simple attempt.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
